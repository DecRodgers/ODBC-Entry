# ODBC-Entry
A tool to quickly insert ODBC DSN Entries into Registry, cutting time for testing connections (granted the details and permissions are correct).

Written circa-2014 (before doing a CS degree) while doing a Software support role to make life easier with installations.



Settings are retrieved from the accompanying .ini file. It takes into account OS Architecture, duplicate entries and overwriting existing ones. You can also set whether it is a User or System DSN.
